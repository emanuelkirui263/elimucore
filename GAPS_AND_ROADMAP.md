# ELIMUCORE - Real-World Gaps & Roadmap (v1.1.0 → v2.0)

**Date**: January 21, 2026  
**Status**: Phase 1 Extension Complete | Phase 2 Planning  
**Goal**: Identify critical gaps before schools deploy to production

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL GAPS (Block Real Usage)

### 🔴 1. Subject-Level Enrollment (CBC + Optional Subjects)

**The Problem**
- Kenya CBC system: Mandatory 8 subjects + optional (Computer Studies, Agriculture, etc.)
- Currently: You assume students take all subjects offered
- Reality: Different students, different subject combinations
- Impact: **KCSE registration will fail**

**Current State**
```javascript
// You track: Student → Marks (via Exam)
// Missing: Student → Subject (explicit enrollment)
Mark.belongsTo(Student)
Mark.belongsTo(Subject)
// No indication which subjects student actually takes
```

**What's Needed**
```javascript
// NEW: StudentSubjectEnrollment
StudentSubjectEnrollment {
  id: UUID
  studentId: UUID (FK)
  subjectId: UUID (FK)
  classStreamId: UUID (FK)  // Per class, subject can vary
  academicYearId: UUID
  isOptional: Boolean       // Computer Studies = true
  enrollmentStatus: ENUM    // ACTIVE, DROPPED, SUBSTITUTED
  enrolledDate: DateTime
  droppedDate: DateTime?
  
  // Constraints
  unique: (studentId, subjectId, academicYearId, classStreamId)
}

// Validate marks
Mark.create() should check StudentSubjectEnrollment first
"Student X taking marks in subject Y without enrollment" = ERROR
```

**Impact of Not Doing This**
- ❌ KCSE candidate list incomplete (wrong subjects listed)
- ❌ Class averages wrong (some students skipped subject)
- ❌ Rankings broken (can't compare students with different subjects)
- ❌ Audits fail (MoE expects enrollment records)

**Effort**: Medium (5-6 hours)  
**Blocks**: KCSE integration, rankings accuracy

---

### 🔴 2. Repeats & Irregular Progression

**The Problem**
- Not all students: Form 1 → Form 2 → Form 3 → Form 4
- Real scenarios:
  - Student repeats Form 2 (failed, stayed 2 years)
  - Student skipped a term (illness, suspension)
  - Student transferred mid-year (not this year, different year)
  - Student joined Form 3 (transferred in)
- Currently: No way to track this. Breaks enrollment logic.

**Current State**
```javascript
// Student has: classLevel, stream, status
// Missing: Progression history per academic year
```

**What's Needed**
```javascript
// NEW: StudentProgression
StudentProgression {
  id: UUID
  studentId: UUID
  academicYearId: UUID
  classLevel: ENUM          // FORM_1, FORM_2, FORM_3, FORM_4
  classStreamId: UUID?      // May repeat without stream change
  enrollmentType: ENUM      // NEW, REPEAT, TRANSFER_IN, SKIP_TERM_RESUME
  previousAcademicYearId: UUID?  // If repeat/resumed
  
  entryDate: DateTime       // When enrolled in this class this year
  exitDate: DateTime?       // When left (graduated, transferred, etc.)
  exitReason: ENUM          // GRADUATED, TRANSFERRED, DROPOUT, INCOMPLETE, SUSPENDED
  
  marksLockedDate: DateTime?  // When year's marks locked (prevents changes)
}

// Example:
// 2024: Form 2 → exitReason: INCOMPLETE (illness)
// 2025: Form 2 → enrollmentType: SKIP_TERM_RESUME (came back)
// 2026: Form 3 → enrollmentType: NEW (progressed normally)
```

**Replaces**: Currently unclear student → class → year mapping

**Impact of Not Doing This**
- ❌ Can't calculate accurate attendance (2-year spans)
- ❌ Rankings compare repeaters to first-timers unfairly
- ❌ Fees calculation breaks (repeat year costs different)
- ❌ KCSE registration confused (which marks count?)

**Effort**: Medium (6-7 hours)  
**Blocks**: Accurate reporting, financial tracking

---

### 🔴 3. Data Integrity Constraints (DB-Level)

**The Problem**
- You rely on ORM validation only
- Database allows contradictions (one student, duplicate marks in same exam)
- When DB queries run in parallel: race conditions

**Current Vulnerabilities**
```sql
-- Should be IMPOSSIBLE but isn't prevented at DB level:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM marks 
WHERE studentId = 'X' AND examId = 'Y' AND subjectId = 'Z'
-- Returns: 2 (should be exactly 1, or error)

-- Orphaned records possible:
DELETE FROM exams WHERE id = 'exam-123'
-- Marks for that exam still exist (data corruption)

-- Student in form that doesn't exist for their school:
INSERT INTO students (classStreamId)
VALUES ('stream-from-different-school')
-- Accepted if checks only in ORM, not DB
```

**What's Needed**

```sql
-- Add composite primary keys
ALTER TABLE marks ADD UNIQUE(studentId, examId, subjectId);
-- Now: Second INSERT → UNIQUE violation (automatic error)

-- Add cascade deletes
ALTER TABLE marks 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_exam_marks 
FOREIGN KEY (examId) REFERENCES exams(id) 
ON DELETE CASCADE;
-- Now: Delete exam → marks auto-deleted (no orphans)

-- Add check constraints
ALTER TABLE marks ADD CHECK(marksObtained >= 0 AND marksObtained <= 100);
-- Now: Insert 150 marks → CHECK violation (error)

-- Add not-null constraints
ALTER TABLE fees 
MODIFY COLUMN amountDue NOT NULL,
MODIFY COLUMN academicYearId NOT NULL;

-- Add campus/school constraints
ALTER TABLE marks 
ADD CONSTRAINT check_student_exam_same_school
FOREIGN KEY (schoolId) REFERENCES exams(schoolId);
-- Ensures: Marks only from exams at student's school
```

**Why ORM Alone Fails**
1. Concurrent requests: ORM checks `if (count == 0) insert` → race condition
2. Direct SQL: Admin writes query, bypasses ORM validations
3. Database corruption: If constraint violated, ORM can't recover

**Impact of Not Doing This**
- ❌ Duplicate marks (2 marks for same exam/student/subject)
- ❌ Invalid data (150/100 marks recorded)
- ❌ Orphaned records (exam deleted, marks remain)
- ❌ Audit failures (data integrity questioned)
- ❌ Ranking errors (uses corrupted data)

**Effort**: Low (2-3 hours, SQL only)  
**Blocks**: Data reliability, audit compliance

---

### 🟧 4. Repeats: Subject Changes Mid-Year

**The Problem**
- Student enrolled in Physics can drop it mid-year → take Agriculture instead
- Or: Can't drop (strict policy)
- Currently: No way to track this decision

**What's Needed**
```javascript
// Extend StudentSubjectEnrollment:
{
  enrollmentStatus: ENUM  // ACTIVE, DROPPED, SUBSTITUTED
  droppedDate: DateTime?
  replacementSubjectId: UUID?  // What they switched to
  approvalReason?: String   // "Parent request", "Avg < 30%", etc.
}

// Validate:
// "Can't drop subject after exam starts" = business rule
// "Form 3 can drop, Form 4 cannot" = school policy
```

**Impact**: Rankings, KCSE registration, attendance

**Effort**: Low (1-2 hours, extends #1)

---

## 🟧 OPERATIONAL GAPS (Admins Notice Quickly)

### 5. School Calendar & Event Management

**Missing**
```javascript
SchoolCalendar {
  id: UUID
  schoolId: UUID
  academicYearId: UUID
  
  // Public holidays (Kenya-specific)
  dateType: ENUM  // PUBLIC_HOLIDAY, EXAM_WEEK, HOLIDAY, NORMAL
  date: Date
  description: String     // "Christmas", "Jamhuri Day"
  
  // Blocks:
  // - Can't take attendance on public holidays (auto-exclude)
  // - Exams scheduled only on school days
  // - Reports show "school days attended" vs "calendar days"
}

// Kenya-specific holidays (template):
[
  { date: "2025-01-01", name: "New Year" },
  { date: "2025-04-25", name: "Anzac Day" },  // Unlikely
  { date: "2025-10-20", name: "Kenyatta Day" },
  { date: "2025-12-25", name: "Christmas" }
]
```

**Impact**
- ❌ Attendance reports include holidays (invalid)
- ❌ Exams scheduled on Christmas (user confusion)
- ❌ Auto-absence flags wrong (says absent 25 Dec)

**Effort**: Low (2 hours)

---

### 6. Exam Moderation & Mark Adjustments

**Missing**
```javascript
MarkAdjustment {
  id: UUID
  markId: UUID
  originalMarks: Number
  adjustedMarks: Number
  reason: ENUM  // MODERATION, SCALING, ERROR_CORRECTION, EXCEPTIONAL_CIRCUMSTANCE
  moderatorId: UUID
  adjustmentDate: DateTime
  approvalStatus: ENUM  // PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED
  notes: Text
}

// Real school example:
// "Form 4 A average: 45/100 (too low)"
// "Increase all by +5 marks" (scaling)
// Mark: 48 → 53
// Recorded: with MarkAdjustment audit trail
```

**Schools Will Ask For**
- Scale all marks in subject (scaling)
- Adjust specific student (error fix)
- Adjust specific class (moderation)

**Impact**
- ❌ Rankings disputed (why is mark 53 when entered 48?)
- ❌ No audit trail (teacher says they didn't change it)
- ❌ Unfair to audit (no evidence of moderation decisions)

**Effort**: Medium (3-4 hours)

---

## 🟨 RISK GAPS (Invisible Until Disaster)

### 7. Bulk Import / Data Migration Tools

**Every school asks**: "Can we upload our old data?"

**Missing**
```javascript
BulkImport {
  id: UUID
  schoolId: UUID
  importType: ENUM  // STUDENTS, STAFF, FEES, MARKS
  file: Binary (CSV)
  
  // Process:
  status: ENUM  // UPLOADED, VALIDATING, VALIDATION_FAILED, READY, IMPORTING, COMPLETED, FAILED
  
  // Results
  totalRows: Number
  validRows: Number
  invalidRows: Number
  errors: JSON  // [ { row: 2, column: "admissionNumber", error: "Duplicate" } ]
  
  // Rollback support
  importedRecordIds: UUID[]  // If failed, can delete these
  completedAt: DateTime?
}

// CSV Format Template (Students):
admissionNumber,firstName,lastName,dateOfBirth,gender,parentName,parentEmail,parentPhone,classLevel
ADM001,John,Doe,2009-06-15,MALE,Joseph Doe,john.dad@email.com,0712345678,FORM_1
ADM002,Jane,Smith,2009-07-20,FEMALE,Mary Smith,jane.mom@email.com,0712345679,FORM_1
```

**Validation Rules**
- Duplicate admission numbers → REJECT ROW
- Invalid gender enum → REJECT ROW
- Missing required fields → REJECT ROW
- Invalid date format → REJECT ROW
- Email format invalid → REJECT ROW

**User Flow**
1. Admin uploads CSV
2. System validates (preview errors)
3. Admin fixes CSV or confirms import
4. System imports with rollback support
5. Audit log records who imported what

**Impact**
- ❌ School can't migrate from old system (stuck)
- ❌ Manual data entry = 10 hours + errors
- ❌ Onboarding takes weeks instead of days

**Effort**: High (8-10 hours)  
**High Impact**: Onboarding speed

---

### 8. Background Jobs & Queues (BullMQ)

**Not Critical Now But Essential At Scale**

**Current Problem**
```javascript
// This blocks the request:
POST /api/reports/batch/report-cards
// Generation: 500 students × 30 seconds = 250 seconds (4+ minutes)
// User waits = timeout or 503 error
```

**Solution**: Job Queue
```javascript
// Instead:
POST /api/reports/batch/report-cards
// Queue job immediately
// Return: { jobId, status: "QUEUED", estimatedTime: 120 }
// User polls OR gets webhook when done

// BullMQ handles:
// - Multiple workers processing in parallel
// - Retry on failure
// - Monitoring dashboard
```

**Tasks to Queue**
- Batch report generation (500+ PDFs)
- SMS sending (1000+ messages)
- Bulk imports
- Analytics computation

**Impact**
- ⚠️ Not blocking → API stays responsive
- ⚠️ Scalable → Can add 5 worker processes

**Effort**: High (10+ hours)  
**Timing**: Phase 2 (only needed if school large)

---

### 9. Monitoring & Alerting (Sentry / DataDog)

**When Something Breaks at 2 AM**

**Currently Missing**
- Error tracking → You find out when school calls
- Performance alerts → Slow queries unnoticed
- Suspicious actions → Someone exported all student data (not tracked)

**Integrate**:
```javascript
// Sentry for errors
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";
Sentry.captureException(error);
// → Dashboard shows errors in real-time
// → Notifies team on Slack

// Performance monitoring
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const start = Date.now();
  res.on('finish', () => {
    const duration = Date.now() - start;
    if (duration > 1000) {
      Sentry.captureMessage(`Slow query: ${req.path} took ${duration}ms`);
    }
  });
  next();
});

// Audit alerts
if (user.role === 'ADMIN' && endpoint === '/api/admin/export-all-data') {
  Sentry.captureMessage(`Admin export by ${user.email}`);
}
```

**Impact**
- ⚠️ You notice errors before school complains
- ⚠️ Can debug slow queries (data visibility)
- ⚠️ Compliance: Tracks who accessed what

**Effort**: Medium (4-5 hours to integrate)  
**Timing**: Phase 2 (before production)

---

## 🟩 PRODUCT GAPS (If Going SaaS)

### 10. Subscription / Licensing Logic

**Even if Free Now**

```javascript
SchoolSubscription {
  id: UUID
  schoolId: UUID
  planType: ENUM  // FREE, PREMIUM, ENTERPRISE
  
  // Limits
  maxStudents: Number
  maxTeachers: Number
  featureFlags: JSON  // { librarian: true, discipline: false }
  
  // Billing
  billingStartDate: DateTime
  billingEndDate: DateTime
  status: ENUM  // ACTIVE, SUSPENDED, CANCELLED
}

// In routes:
if (school.subscription.maxStudents < enrolledStudents) {
  return res.status(403).json({ 
    error: "Student limit reached. Upgrade to Premium." 
  });
}
```

**Why Now**: Avoid hard-coding later

---

### 11. White-Labeling & Branding

```javascript
SchoolBranding {
  id: UUID
  schoolId: UUID
  
  // UI
  logoUrl: String       // School logo
  primaryColor: String  // #FF6B6B
  secondaryColor: String
  
  // Reports
  letterheadUrl: String  // PDF header image
  
  // Email
  emailFrom: String  // "accounts@schoolname.ac.ke"
}

// When PDF generated:
const doc = new PDFDocument();
doc.image(school.branding.letterheadUrl, 0, 0, { width: 595 });
```

**Impact**: Massive trust boost (school feels ownership)

## 🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION (Prioritized)

### ✅ DO IMMEDIATELY (v1.2.0 - Week 2)

**Effort: 17 hours | Blocks: KCSE + Accuracy**

1. **Subject Enrollment** (5h) → KCSE requirement, blocks rankings
2. **Repeats/Progression** (6h) → Breaks entire enrollment logic
3. **DB Constraints** (2h) → Data integrity, easy win
4. **Subject Changes** (2h) → Extends #1, KCSE requirement
5. **School Calendar** (2h) → Fixes attendance

**Outcome**: System works correctly for real schools

---

### ✅ DO SOON (v1.3.0 - Week 3-4)

**Effort: 15 hours | Improves UX + Compliance**

6. **Exam Moderation** (3h) → Schools demand this
7. **Bulk Import** (8h) → Onboarding blocker
8. **DB Monitoring** (4h) → Before production deploy

**Outcome**: Schools can migrate existing data + audit compliance

---

### ⏳ DO LATER (v2.0 - Phase 2)

**Effort: 14+ hours | Needed for Scale + SaaS**

9. **Background Jobs** (10h) → Only if 1000+ students or 500+ bulk imports
10. **Comprehensive Monitoring** (4h) → Before scaling to 10+ schools
11. **Subscription Logic** (3h) → If going commercial

**Outcome**: Production-ready for enterprise deployment

---

### ❌ DON'T BUILD (Not Worth It)

- ❌ **Biometrics** - Schools don't have infrastructure, high cost
- ❌ **AI Grading** - Trust issue, regulatory question
- ❌ **Face Recognition** - Privacy liability
- ❌ **KCSE API Dreams** - KCSE likely won't provide API (they don't publish yet)
- ❌ **Blockchain** - Why? (unnecessary complexity)
- ❌ **Mobile Native** - React Native after web stable
- ❌ **Multi-language** - English good enough for MVP

---

---

## 📋 Detailed Implementation Plan (Top 3)

### Subject Enrollment (Priority #1)

**Models**:
```javascript
// NEW
StudentSubjectEnrollment {
  id, studentId, subjectId, classStreamId, academicYearId,
  isOptional, enrollmentStatus, enrolledDate, droppedDate, replacementSubjectId
}

// UPDATE Mark model
Mark {
  // ... existing fields
  // Must validate: StudentSubjectEnrollment must exist before allowing mark
}

// UPDATE Ranking
// Only compare students with same subject enrollment
```

**Validation**:
- Can't enter mark for subject student didn't enroll in
- Can't drop subject after exam completed
- Form 4 can't change subjects (policy)

**API Endpoints** (8):
```
POST   /api/academics/enrollment                 // Enroll student in subject
GET    /api/academics/enrollment/:studentId      // List subject enrollments
GET    /api/academics/enrollment/class/:classId  // Class subjects
PUT    /api/academics/enrollment/:id             // Update enrollment
POST   /api/academics/enrollment/:id/drop        // Drop subject
POST   /api/academics/enrollment/:id/substitute  // Replace subject
GET    /api/academics/subjects/optional          // List optional subjects
```

**Frontend** (2 pages):
- Subject enrollment manager
- Class subject matrix (who takes what)

**Testing**:
- [ ] Student with 8 subjects (standard)
- [ ] Student with 7 + optional
- [ ] Student drops Computer Studies mid-year
- [ ] Rankings exclude dropped subjects
- [ ] KCSE list only enrolled subjects

**Effort**: 5 hours backend + 4 hours frontend = **9 hours**

---

### Repeats & Progression (Priority #2)

**Models**:
```javascript
// NEW
StudentProgression {
  id, studentId, academicYearId, classLevel, classStreamId,
  enrollmentType, previousAcademicYearId, entryDate, exitDate, 
  exitReason, marksLockedDate
}

// UPDATE Student model
Student {
  // Remove direct classLevel (derive from StudentProgression)
  // Add: getCurrentClassLevel(), getProgressionHistory()
}

// UPDATE Mark validation
Mark.create() → Check StudentProgression for that academicYear
```

**Enrollment Types**:
- NEW → First time in this form
- REPEAT → Same form again (failed)
- TRANSFER_IN → Different school
- SKIP_TERM_RESUME → Returned after absence

**Exit Reasons**:
- GRADUATED → Form 4 → Alumni
- TRANSFERRED → Changed schools
- DROPOUT → Left entirely
- INCOMPLETE → Didn't finish year
- SUSPENDED → Disciplinary

**API Endpoints** (10):
```
POST   /api/students/progression              // Create progression record
GET    /api/students/:id/progression-history  // Full history
POST   /api/students/:id/progress-next-form   // Promote to next form
POST   /api/students/:id/repeat-form          // Fail → repeat same form
POST   /api/students/:id/suspend-term         // Mark absent (illness)
POST   /api/students/:id/resume-after-absence // Come back
GET    /api/academics/repeaters/:classId      // List repeaters in class
GET    /api/analytics/progression-stats       // % repeating, % graduating
```

**Business Logic**:
- Form 4 → Graduate (can't repeat) → Alumni
- Skip > 1 term → Auto-dropout
- Repeater: Can't enroll in Form 5+ (doesn't exist)

**Effort**: 6 hours backend + 3 hours frontend = **9 hours**

---

## 🔵 PHASE 3+ GAPS (Experience-Driven, Rare)

These gaps only appear after **2-3 years of live use** with 100+ schools.

### 28. Legal Evidence & Dispute Support

**Only needed when a case goes to court.**

Missing:
- Immutable audit exports (PDF/CSV with digital signature)
- "Who changed what, when" certificate
- Signed report cards (tamper-proof)

**When to Build**: When a school requests it (probably year 2)  
**How to Add**: ADMIN-only feature (enable per school)  
**Effort**: 2-3 days

---

### 29. Teacher Substitution & Relief Tracking

**Rare, but real in large schools.**

Missing:
- Substitute teacher assignment
- Temporary timetable override
- Attendance attribution (actual teacher vs. substitute)

**When to Build**: When schools have 50+ permanent teachers  
**How to Add**: Create TeacherSubstitution model (links to Timetable)  
**Effort**: 1-2 days

**Why not now**: < 5% of pilot schools need this

---

### 30. Multi-Campus / Annex Support

**Some national schools have main campus + day wing.**

Missing:
- Campus entity (main site, annex, boarding wing)
- Campus-scoped attendance & assets
- Campus-level reports

**When to Build**: When targeting national school chains  
**How to Add**: Add campus_id to critical tables  
**Effort**: 2-3 days

**Why not now**: Complicates system for 95% of schools

---

### 31. Government Inspections Mode

**MoE inspectors want read-only access.**

Missing:
- Read-only access mode (no edits)
- Time-limited accounts (2 weeks)
- Inspection-only views (subset of data)

**When to Build**: When MoE adopts system  
**How to Add**: New role (INSPECTOR) with limited permissions  
**Effort**: 4 hours

**Why not now**: Premature optimization

---

### 32. End-of-Year Closure Workflow

**Prevents "silent data corruption" after year ends.**

Missing:
- Year-close checklist (all marks submitted? all fees settled?)
- Forced archive (no more changes after close)
- Data lock after closure
- Alumni archive

**When to Build**: Before year 2 starts  
**How to Add**: Add closed_at to AcademicYear  
**Effort**: 1 day

**Why not now**: You have time before December 2026

---

## 🧠 THE HONEST TRUTH

**There is nothing left that indicates a design gap.**

What remains are:

| Category | What's Left | When |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Policy features | Dispute support, inspections | Year 2 |
| Rare workflows | Substitutes, multi-campus | Year 1-2 |
| Scale problems | System slows at 5,000 students | Year 2 |
| SaaS needs | White-label, subscriptions | Year 2-3 |

---

## The Honest Assessment

**You don't have gaps in what you built.  
You're discovering the shape of the problem.**

Every system finds these when schools actually use it:
- "Wait, can a student take different subjects?"
- "What if they failed Form 3, do they repeat?"
